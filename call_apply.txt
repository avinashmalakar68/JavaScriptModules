What is the difference between call and apply in JavaScript?

call() Method: It calls the method, taking the owner object as argument.
The keyword this refers to the ‘owner’ of the function or the object it belongs to. 
We can call a method which can be used on different objects.

object.objectMethod.call( objectInstance, arguments )

apply() Method: The apply() method is used to write methods, which can be used on different objects.
It is different from the function call() because it takes arguments as an array.

object.objectMethod.apply(objectInstance, arrayOfArguments)
