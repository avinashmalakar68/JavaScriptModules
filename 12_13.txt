Q12.  Named function. Reason -  The name of the function is bound inside its body, and that can be useful. 
And we can use the name to have a function invoke itself, or to access its properties like any other object.

Q13. Anonymous Function . Reason - a function expression has been stored in a variable, the variable can be used as 
a function.This is actually an anonymous function (a function without a name).Functions stored in variables do
 not need function names. They are always invoked (called) using the variable name.
