               **************Local strorage and session storage **********

localStorage and sessionStorage accomplish the exact same thing and have the same API,
but with sessionStorage the data is persisted only until the window or tab is closed, 
while with localStorage the data is persisted until the user manually clears the browser
cache or until your web app clears the data.
